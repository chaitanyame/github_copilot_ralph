# Claude Progress Notes

This file bridges context between agent sessions. Each agent reads this at the start of their session and updates it at the end.

## Current Status

**Project**: Agent Harness Framework (Template Repository)
**Status**: Ready for use as template
**Features**: Template - not applicable
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-04

## What's Been Done

This is a **template repository** for building long-lived agents. It includes:

- ✅ Directory structure for agents, prompts, and memory
- ✅ Spec Kit prompts (`/speckit.*`) for spec-driven development
- ✅ Harness prompts (`/harness.*`) for session management
- ✅ Agent definitions (Initializer, Coder, Planner, Researcher, Reviewer, Orchestrator)
- ✅ Scripts for project setup (Bash and PowerShell)
- ✅ Templates for specs, plans, tasks, and feature lists
- ✅ VS Code configuration for Copilot integration
- ✅ **Playwright testing support** - instructions and templates

## Session History

### Session 4 - 2024-12-04

**Feature**: Add Git Feature Branching to Workflow
**Status**: ✅ Complete

#### Accomplished
- Updated `@Coder` agent with feature branching steps:
  - Step 5: Create feature branch before implementing
  - Step 9: Commit and push to feature branch
  - Step 10: Create PR or merge to dev
- Updated `/speckit.implement` prompt with branching workflow
- Created `.github/instructions/git-branching.instructions.md`:
  - Branch naming conventions
  - Workflow per feature
  - Commit message format
  - Recovery procedures

#### Files Changed
- `.github/agents/coder.agent.md` (updated)
- `.github/prompts/speckit.implement.prompt.md` (updated)
- `.github/instructions/git-branching.instructions.md` (new)

#### Branch Workflow Now
```
1. git checkout -b feature/{id}-{name}
2. Implement feature
3. git commit -m "feat({id}): {name}"
4. git push origin feature/{id}-{name}
5. Create PR or merge to dev
```

### Session 3 - 2024-12-04

**Feature**: Verify Anthropic Pattern Compliance
**Status**: ✅ Complete

#### Accomplished
- Reviewed Anthropic autonomous-coding repository principles
- Verified framework follows all key patterns:
  - Two-agent pattern (Initializer + Coder) ✅
  - feature_list.json as source of truth ✅
  - Progress notes for context bridging ✅
  - init.sh for environment setup ✅
  - Git-based incremental progress ✅
  - One-feature-at-a-time enforcement ✅
  - Verification before implementation ✅

#### Files Reviewed
- `.github/agents/coder.agent.md` - follows session protocol
- `memory/feature_list.json` - has rules for passes-only edits
- `init.sh` - displays progress, checks prerequisites
- `AGENTS.md` - documents all principles

#### No Changes Needed
Framework is compliant with Anthropic patterns.

### Session 2 - 2024-12-04

**Feature**: Add Playwright UI Testing Support
**Status**: ✅ Complete

#### Accomplished
- Created `.github/instructions/playwright.instructions.md` with:
  - Setup instructions
  - Best practices (Page Object Model, data-testid, assertions)
  - Running tests commands
  - Configuration template
  - Integration with harness feature verification
- Created `templates/tests/feature.spec.template.ts` - Playwright test template
- Updated `templates/docs/spec-template.md` - Added UI Tests section

#### Files Changed
- `.github/instructions/playwright.instructions.md` (new)
- `templates/tests/feature.spec.template.ts` (new)
- `templates/docs/spec-template.md` (updated)

#### Next Steps
- Commit changes
- Consider adding example Playwright config to templates
